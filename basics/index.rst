Getting Started
==============================

**Thunder Engine** is an open-source multi-functional lightweight game engine for creating 2D and 3D games.
It provides a wide range of frameworks and tools. So developers can focus on the creation, and the Thunder Engine will do the routine.

The main ideology of project is to create the modular engine to give developers an ability to exclude modules which they are not using in their project to keep their projects lightweight.
API of Thunder Engine is also allowing to create own modules to use them in your games.
Or create editor modules to help develop them.
