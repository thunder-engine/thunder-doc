Graphics Pipeline
=================

Thunder Engine employs a flexible graphics pipeline that allows you to fine-tune the balance between quality and performance on an individual project basis.
This flexibility ensures that you can tailor the graphical settings to meet the specific requirements of your project, providing a versatile solution for achieving the desired visual fidelity while maintaining optimal performance.

The graphics pipeline in Thunder Engine is task-based, representing each graphical feature as a task in the pipeline.
This task-oriented approach forms a graph that efficiently processes and renders graphics tasks.
This system allows for a modular and scalable approach to handling graphics tasks, contributing to the engine's adaptability and efficiency in managing complex visual scenarios.
