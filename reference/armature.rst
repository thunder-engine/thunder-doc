Description
-----------

An armature in Thunder Engine can be thought of as similar to the armature of a real skeleton, and just like a real skeleton. These bones can be moved around and anything that they are attached to or associated with will move and deform in a similar way. An armature uses the Transform component in a child object like a bone structure.
